//inheritance is a process of acquiring properties of one class by another class. it is used to resuse code and to reduce code redundancy
//its types are:
//single level: if one or more child class inherits one parent
//multilevel: if first class gets inherited by second and second class interns gets inherited third and so on. It is like grandparent , parent  and child relation
//Multiple: If one child class can inherit more than one parent then such condition is multipe inheritance 
//those class tha inherits other class is sub class, derive
//thse class that gets inherited by ither class is super class
